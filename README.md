# course-rest-api

I have performed 7 simple servies for course rest api using list collection in spring boot
1. Display all courses
2. Get course details based on batch code
3. Get the name of all faculties
4. Get all batch codes of specific faculty
5. Get all batches where total classes more than 50
6. Add new batch details
7. Delete specific batch details based on batch code
